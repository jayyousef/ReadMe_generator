## Description <a name="introduction"></a>
This project will build a custom readme file based on the user input. The goal is to make the lives of developers a little bit easier so they can spend more time creating their projects and less time formatting their README files.

### Motivation
I usually build a bare bones README file, but save the final formation until the end of my project. It can be challenging to sum up the project when there is still important work to be done and bugs to sort, so I thought of a way that I can make my life a little bit easier, and the lives of other developers, to speed the process a little bit.


### Problem Solved
While this project won’t eliminate the need for thoughtful responses, I hope this makes it a little bit easier to create a professional looking README to display to other users or prospective employers. 
This project was great practice on using inquirer user responses to create a file that will actually help future developers solve a small problem.:

## Credits
After installing the project, make sure to navigate to the correct directory and run “npm init -y” and then “npm install” After you’ve got the project ready, simple run “node index.js” or “node .” Answer the questions as they appear in the terminal and you can find your new file in the main directory.
